# Number Guessing Web Application

Welcome to the Number Guessing Web Application! This is a twist on the traditional number guessing game. Instead of you trying to guess a number chosen by the computer, the roles are reversed: you choose a number between 1 and 1000, and the computer will attempt to guess it!

## How to Play:

1. Start the game and think of a number between 1 and 1000, but don't tell the computer.
2. The computer will make a guess.
3. Use the provided buttons to give feedback to the computer:
   - **Too small**: If the computer's guess is too low.
   - **Too big**: If the computer's guess is too high.
   - **You win**: When the computer guesses your number correctly.

The computer will guess your number in 10 tries or fewer, as long as you're not cheating!
